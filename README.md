## Events

* `clicked`

Sent when the node name is clicked

* `expand`

Sent when the node is clicked and the node children are expanded

* `retract`

Sent when the node is clicked and the node children are retracted

For all these events, the argument passed is `{element, data}` where `element` represents the node build by `D3.js` and `data` is the node raw data.

* `zoom`

Sent when the tree is zoomed. Argument: `{transform}` where transform is [d3.zoom transform object](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom#zoom-transforms)

## Events

* `mouseNodeOver`

Sent when the node name is hovered by mouse

* `mouseNodeOut`

Sent when mouse leaves the node name

For these events, the argument passed is `{element, data}` where `element` represents the node build by `D3.js` and `data` is the node raw data.

* `clickOutsideGraph`

Sent when mouse is clicked outside any geometry or text of the hierarchical edge bundling

* `nodesComputed`

Sent when D3.js nodes are computed using `data` props. Called with [D3.js hierarchy node](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy#hierarchy)

* `highlightedNodeChanged`

Sent when highlighted node has changed.

## data

* `highlightedNode`

Highlighted node: when set to a node data, the corresponding node and its related links will be highlighted. If null standard display is showing.
